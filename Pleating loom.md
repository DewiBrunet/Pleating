### 1)	Situation

Pleating is a technique of textile ennobling used to fold a material to give it a form memory. This craft dates as far as ancient Egypt with a consequent development during the 18th century with the use of new technique of fabrication with machines. Nowadays, it is declining and in Europe only a few craftsman's houses are still in activity, working mainly for haute couture. Famous pleated creator/studio include: Fortuny, Lognon, Siminneli, Issey Miyake                 



This recent decline is partially due to industrial machines making the simple patterns but also due to a lack of transmission of the know-hows, most of the complex pattern being made manually. Sadly, most of the artisan were and are still are very reluctant to openly share their knowledge…                  
The advantages of textile pleating are however numerous and should not be restricted to esthetic or the fashion industry. Pleating offers: memory of form, optimization of material, large deployment capacity, pattern, volume.

One of the most famous technique used for textile pleating uses two folded paper molds were the textile is put inside, closed together and put in a steamer to fix the pleats. Historically, the creator making the molds and the ones using them were two separate jobs. Nowadays, only few still know how to make precise and complex molds, most of them still use century old ones like in Lognon.


How to learn it today when no info can be found on internet and only few specialists accept to share their knowledge?                 
How to practice it when it can be difficult to find the right tools?                 
Is it possible to rediscover this lost heritage and modernize it?                 

A few creators tend to tackle this challenge, like Samira Boon working in the Textilab of Tilburg. She explores new methods for textile pleating with industrial looms.
Dewi Brunet, artist specialized in folding and autodidact practitioner of textile pleating for a few years also wants to propose solutions. He has been growing his technological skills in the fablab OpenFab in Brussels where he developed … 
                 
This documentation was made possible thanks to the network of fablabs of brussels.
Dewi Brunet explored further his prototype and documented them at the Microfactory & Cityfab3 during novembre 2022.



### 2)	Making the loom
The … is a 
Le « métier à plier » se compose d’une plaque de bois gravée d’un motif à la découpeuse laser. Une fois sortie de la machine, il servira pour embosser le motif sur un papier. Il permet de recréer plus précisément, plus rapidement des moules à plisser et aider le pliage (complexe).
The … consists of a wooden plate engraved by a laser with a specific pattern. It is used to emboss the pattern on a paper making it easier, faster and more precise to fold.

- It’s a tool for exploring new pattern.
- It’s a tool for producing repetitive folding.
- It’s a pedagogical tool for folding beginners. 

For this you need :
- 1 piece of wood
- a laser cutting machine (go to your local fablab for this)
- the file below

[Fichier Matrices.pdf](https://github.com/DewiBrunet/Plissage/files/10178526/Fichier.Matrices.pdf)


Recommendation :
- Thickness : 2 to 4mm
- Size : I provide a large ….x…cm and a small …x… cm …. but feel free to modify or create your own
- Type of wood : poplar (easy to engrave) or meranti (very strong)
- Laser settings : make a few try before engraving your … I recommend to slightly offset the focal to have a wider line (+/- 1mm is good, depending on your embossing tool)

Fails
Yes many fails were made before having the pico bello …           
If the lines are too thin it will be difficult to find them with your embossing tool.           
If the lines are too large the folding will be more difficult to make and less precise.           
If the lines are not deep enough it will be difficult to find them while embossing.           
If the lines are too deep paper can break more easily while embossing.           
Find the right settings on your machine

### 3) Using the loom
Now that your … is made, time to use it !

You will need :
- The ….
- Paper clip or tape
- An embossing tool (for pro you can find them in scrapbooking or bookbinding shops but an empty pen can be very fine for this).
- Paper (I personally use a 120g)

##### Step 1 : cut your paper to fit the size of the … (I left a margin of 5mm on each size that you can cut after)
##### Step 2 : clip it or tape it so that it will not move during the process (! If it moves it will be very difficult to place it back to its exact place). You might want to leave a free corner to lift the paper if you are not sure were the lines are at first.
##### Step 3 : start embossing following the lines with your tool (it might take you a bit of practice to find the right force – too much might weaken/break the paper, too little will make the folding difficult).

##### Step 4 : remove clip/tape, cut the paper margin and start folding

##### Step 5 : folding process depends on your pattern by I find it easier to start by making the horizontal mountain/valley fold in accordion then the other folds.
##### Step 6 : repeat process another time to have your second mold ready for textile pleating.
##### Step 7 : unfold everything to make paper flat

##### Step 8 : yes, now open the two molds and place your textile in the middle, like a sandwich of paper/textile/paper (! Make sure the pattern are in the same way)
##### Step 9 : fold everything back together like if it was just one piece of material.

##### Step 10 : tight everything closely together using clips or ropes
##### Step 11 : place in steamer for +/-1h, or less for prototyping (not the best solution but you can also iron it for a while instead).

##### Step 12 : wait for it to cool down and open it to admire your textile pleating, congratulation!
